You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:apple\nexplanation:I chose \"apple\" as my first guess because it is a common five-letter word, and it contains a mix of vowels and consonants, which can provide a good starting point for identifying the target word.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:elegy\nexplanation:The feedback indicates that the letter 'e' is in the target word but in a different position. I chose \"elegy\" as my next guess because it maintains the correct letter 'e' while introducing new letters 'l', 'g', and 'y'. This guess will help determine the placement of 'e' and provide more information about the target word.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: e<yellow> l<red> e<red> g<red> y<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:elbow\nexplanation:The feedback shows that the letter 'e' is still in the correct position, and we now know that 'l' is not in the target word. I selected \"elbow\" as my next guess because it retains the correct 'e' and introduces a new letter 'b'. This guess will help confirm the presence of 'e' and provide more clues about the target word's composition.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: e<yellow> l<red> b<red> o<yellow> w<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:elbow\nexplanation:The feedback indicates that the letters 'e' and 'o' are in the correct positions, but 'l' and 'b' are not. I decided to stick with \"elbow\" as my next guess because it maintains the correct letters 'e' and 'o' while swapping the positions of 'l' and 'b'. This guess will help determine the correct placement of 'l' and 'b' and provide further refinement of the target word.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: e<yellow> l<red> b<red> o<yellow> w<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:elbow\nexplanation:The feedback remains the same, indicating that the letters 'e' and 'o' are in the correct positions, but 'l' and 'b' are not. I will stick with \"elbow\" as my next guess to confirm the placement of 'l' and 'b' and to ensure that the target word is indeed \"elbow\". This guess will provide the final confirmation needed to solve the Wordle puzzle.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: e<yellow> l<red> b<red> o<yellow> w<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": "<BOS_TOKEN><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
