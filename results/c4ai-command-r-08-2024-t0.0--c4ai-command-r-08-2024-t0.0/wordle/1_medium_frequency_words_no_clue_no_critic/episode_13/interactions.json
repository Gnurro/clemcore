You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-02T15:13:10.393278", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: I chose \"apple\" as my first guess because it is a common five-letter word, and it contains a mix of vowels and consonants, which can provide a good starting point for identifying the target word. \n\nNow, let's await the feedback for this guess to refine our strategy for the next attempt."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-02T15:13:10.393281", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "I chose \"apple\" as my first guess because it is a common five-letter word, and it contains a mix of vowels and consonants, which can provide a good starting point for identifying the target word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-02T15:13:10.393316", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = rifle\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<green> e<green>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "rifle", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (c4ai-command-r-08-2024)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "I chose \"apple\" as my first guess because it is a common five-letter word, and it contains a mix of vowels and consonants, which can provide a good starting point for identifying the target word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-09-02T15:13:14.609636", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<green> e<green>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-02T15:13:14.609689", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:level\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that the letters 'l' and 'e' are correct and in the right position.
