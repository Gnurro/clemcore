You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:apple\nexplanation:I chose \"apple\" as my first guess because it is a common five-letter word, and it contains a mix of vowels and consonants, which can provide a good starting point for identifying the target word.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<green> e<green><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:level\nexplanation:The feedback indicates that the letters 'l' and 'e' are correct and in the right position. I am guessing \"level\" as it maintains the correct letters and has a similar structure to \"apple,\" with the hope of narrowing down the possibilities. The word \"level\" also has a good balance of vowels and consonants, which can provide useful information for further guesses.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: l<yellow> e<yellow> v<red> e<red> l<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:leaky\nexplanation:The feedback shows that the letters 'l' and 'e' are correct but in the wrong position. By guessing \"leaky,\" I am keeping the correct letters and trying a new combination. The word \"leaky\" maintains the 'l' and 'e' while introducing a new vowel, 'a,' and a consonant, 'k,' which can help identify the target word's structure and letter distribution.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: l<yellow> e<yellow> a<red> k<red> y<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:leash\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, the letters 'l' and 'e' are still correct but misplaced. With \"leash,\" I am keeping the correct letters and changing the other positions to explore new possibilities. The word \"leash\" has a similar structure to \"leaky\" but with a different vowel and consonant, which can provide more information about the target word's composition.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: l<yellow> e<yellow> a<red> s<red> h<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:leery\nexplanation:The feedback indicates that the letters 'l' and 'e' are still correct but in the wrong spots. By guessing \"leery,\" I am maintaining the correct letters and trying a new combination. The word \"leery\" has a similar structure to \"leash\" but with a different vowel and consonant, which can help refine our understanding of the target word's composition and letter distribution.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: l<yellow> e<yellow> e<red> r<yellow> y<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": "<BOS_TOKEN><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
